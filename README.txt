This is a Caesar cypher project, which takes in a string, and moves in steps to decrypt it. Only roman alphabetic characters will
be decrypted. Any other characters in the input string will remain the same.

You can replace the alphabet with any other string, for example, to Cyrllic or to Greek. Just replace the alphabet variable.

To run the project, make sure you have Python 3 installed on your local machine. After this, you can run the file directly using
your version of python, through an IDE, or through the terminal.

Have fun!
